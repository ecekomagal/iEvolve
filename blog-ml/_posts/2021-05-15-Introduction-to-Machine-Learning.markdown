Recent trending buzz word - Machine Learning’ isn’t quite new. It has been in use many decades ago even before Arthur Samuel coined the term machine learning as a “Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. Since due to recent development in computer processing power and availability of multiples open source libraries, ML models have been made easily available to anyone to develop and experiment further.  

Those ML models have been optimized over several decades, so as of now what we need to do is to understand how the model work and when to use them instead of getting screwed up with its complexities. So in my upcoming post I try to focus on its basics and how we can easily apply those ML models practically. Once you understand this basics, you can explore each and every particular model in depth.
