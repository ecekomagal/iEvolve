1. Regression – what will be the value of a variable? For example, what should be the price of a specific home.
2. Classification – Given available groups, which group does this belong to? For example, will a patient survive or die.
3. Clustering – Without knowing any groups, which group does this belong to? For example, given this data about website visitors, see if you can find some similarities amongst different customers and group them somehow.

# Different ML models

For each of the problems mentioned above, there are multiple models depending on type of relationship and some other factors. Here is a short list of most popular models:

## Regression
    - Simple Linear Regression model
    - Multiple Linear Regression model
    - Polynomial Regression model
    - Support Vector Regression model
    - Decision Tree Regression model
    - Random Forest Regression model

## Classification
    - Logistic Regression model
    - K-Nearest Neighbors model
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM) model
    - Kernel SVM model
    - Naive Bayes model
    - Decision Tree Classification model
    - Random Forest Classification model

## Clustering
    - K-Means Clustering model
    - Hierarchal Clustering model

Each of these models has its pros and cons and it takes practice to understand when and how to use the right model.
