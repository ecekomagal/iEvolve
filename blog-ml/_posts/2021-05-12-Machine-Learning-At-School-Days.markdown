Lets see its use case in the following blog"

I guess everybody aware of our 12th grade simple pendulum – Physics lab experiment to measure the acceleration due to gravity, where we   try to find the effective length of simple pendulum for a given time period. The lab consist of collecting data (L, T2) and then plotting it to understand the relationship between those two variables (independent and dependent variables). To identify the relationship between the independent and dependent variable, most of the times we would find a linear relationship. 

Using MS Excel or Scale, we would draw a line-of-best-fit which would try to encapsulate the relationship. The line would have an equation in the form: y = mx + b where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, b is the y-intercept and m is the slope. Once you draw the line, you can find the slope (m) and y-intercept (b). And once you have the equation, you can then predict values of y for any value of x.  So basically machine learning is all about same thing, where here we will be training certain ML model by feeding experimental data’s to identify the key relationship among the variables and later use those trained model to predict the desired outcomes.
