Rapid development in the fields of Internet of things, robotics, big data, sensors, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and rapid prototyping technologies have noticeably transcended into manufacturing industry. This unprecedented occurrence is often referred to as “the fourth industrial revolution” or “Industry 4.0” that has gained considerable momentum in recent years. 

In today’s industrial space, digitization of manufacturing process is of core importance, as reaching customer satisfaction is a multi-stage, never-ending process that needs to be modified as customer needs change all the time. In which Industry 4.0 plays a crucial role, where its central objective is all about fulfilling individual customer needs which affects in areas like order management, research and development, sustainability, manufacturing and delivery up to the utilization and recycling of the product. 

Industry 4.0 is all about convergence of industrial control system and information technology where people, machines and products communicate with one another via internet. It’s basically a compilation of an array of technology and engineering concepts, that allows primary process information to control the manufacturing process and secondary information, used for diagnostic, predictive, process and customer improvement activities. So basically in this section of my blog I try cover on Industrial Energy Management Practices, Industrial Internet of Things and Big Data Analytics.
 
In Industrial Space, the need for industry 4.0 is to convert regular machine to self-aware and self-learning machines to improve their overall performance and maintenance management with connected systems.

Industry 4.0 is a compilation of an array of technology and engineering concepts, but out of these, the four most significant ones include people, end-to-end engineering, modularity and connectivity. And it’s all about convergence of industry and internet technology where People, machines and products communicate with one another via internet.
