One of the latest innovations in the industrial environment was the emergence of Industry 4.0. This lead to digital transformation of manufacturing process, that can offer opportunities to address the problem of energy efficiency, which is of a critical tool that needs to be adopted in varied industrial space for its sustainable product development. Efficient energy management can be achieved through, optimization or replacement of specific resources. But now days, many innovative digital technologies can offer new tools for energy optimization. For example, controlling the behavior of large number of interconnected motors by a software tool that reduces energy consumption is one such example for digital innovations that’s been happening.

, the application of new software tools that can offer energy optimization functionality, or adaptations in the new business processes. Controlling the behavior of large number of interconnected motors by an algorithm that reduces energy consumption is one such example for optimizing resources with respect to specific technology. But now days, many innovative digital technologies can also offer the chance for replacement of conventional, often more energy intensive manufacturing process.

In context of Industry 4.0, the need for energy efficiency and energy flexibility is becoming more important, as it helps companies to reduce their energy consumption and thereby reduce cost of product and stay compatible in the market place. Therefore, strategic energy management plays an important role in overcoming these obstacles.

Sustainable Energy Transition through Industry 4.0, is still a new approach that require more investigation and has not attracted very much attention in research yet. But however, there are many opportunities on how sustainable energy concepts can be incorporated into digital factory.
