              <p>Industry 4.0 is all about convergence of industrial control system and information technology where people, machines and products communicate with one another via internet. It’s basically a compilation of an array of technology and engineering concepts, that allows primary process information to control the manufacturing process and secondary information, used for diagnostic, predictive, process and customer improvement activities. So basically in this section of my blog I try cover on Industrial Supply Chain & Logistics Management Practices, Industrial Internet of Things and Big Data Analytics.</p>
